# Random-Forest-project
# Project Title: 

Classifier the random forest using skit earn  "Random Forest Classifier" for iris.csv. and predict the data how many species are inter connected with Nth Descision Tree Nth Node

# Problem Statement:

TASK-1 

Import the random forest classifier by using sklearn.ensemble library

TASK-2

Load your data using c born graphics library "load_iris"

TASK-3

Pre process trhe data using skit learn libraries

TASK-4

Select the model using "model_selection" from sns as a seaborn and sklearn as a skit learn machine library

TASK-5

Load the iris.csv dataset for "Data" as a input variable and "Target" as a functionable output variable

TASK-6

Choose the train and test data using argument library train_test_split

TASK-7

Select the estimators as a Nth Decision tree

TASK-8

Use a random forect classifier and fit your model

TASK-9

Finf out the accuracy of a model

# Project Approach:

## Train the classifier on the training data
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)

RandomForestClassifier

RandomForestClassifier()

# Project Accuracy:
##Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")


Accuracy: 1.00

# Conclusion:

my model as approch 1.00 accuracy ,which is lies between in the range of 0-1.
Hence it is shows that random forest decision model successfully implemented
